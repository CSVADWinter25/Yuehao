How I designed my assignment

My inspiration for this assignment came from the symmetrical drawing example in class, 
where the canvas displays the mirrored line drawn on the opposite side of the horizontal and vertical symmetrical lines
at each frame. As it is almost the Chinese New Year, 
and the red paper cut is a traditional folk art usually stuck on the windows, 
I was inspired to modify the example a little bit and change it into an “octagon-symmetrical” pattern 
that radiates from the center point.

The designing of the logic for the code is buttressed with Chat GPT. 
It indicates that at every frame, when a new dot of the original line is drawn by the mouse, t
he program automatically creates seven more reflection dots. 
In an octagon, each symmetrical angle is (360° / 8 = 45°). 
When a new dot on the original position of the mouse is drawn, just like the example in class, 
the other three dots are created according to the horizontal and vertical symmetrical lines, 
as well as the diagonal dot. 
A for loop is executed to rotate the baseline for 45 degrees every time and to draw the rotated dots. 
The “drawSymmetricLine” function in the code takes care of drawing one line and all its reflections.

Since the paper cuts are usually red to symbolize harmony and luck for the upcoming new year, 
the program is designed to draw the new dots of the lines with dark and light red colors. 
With the code “stroke(200 - s1, s2 * 0.5, s2 * 0.6);” written, 
it oscillates between different gradients of red colors as the parameters “s1” and “s2” 
switches back and forth between the value of 1 to 100. The same applies to the thickness of the lines.

As a result, the program generates a kaleidoscope-like paper cut pattern, 
and I do believe it is great for generating the “window paper cuts” for the upcoming Chinese New Year.
