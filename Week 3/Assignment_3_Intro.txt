Assignment 3:Gear-Wheel Simulation in Processing

This project is a gear-wheel simulation built using Processing, 
featuring multiple gears of varying sizes that spin dynamically in different directions. 
Each gear is positioned at a fixed-random location, 
with its size and movement parameters stored in lists for easy control and modification.

The simulation allows customization of the number of gears displayed and their general spinning speed, 
making it flexible for different visual effects. 
Each individual gear is constructed from four rectangular boxes, 
which are positioned and oriented based on a calculated phase increment to simulate rotational motion.

To achieve smooth animation, two nested for-loops in the draw() function iterate through the gears, 
updating their positions and rendering them each frame. While the gears rotate and animate as expected, 
one challenge remains: the color settings do not apply properly to the "box" objects, 
which may be due to Processingâ€™s rendering limitations or an issue with how materials 
and lighting are handled in the 3D space.

This project combines randomized positioning, structured rotation mechanics, 
and list-based data management to create a visually engaging and procedurally controlled scene. 
Future improvements may include fixing the color issue, adding lighting effects, 
or refining the rotation mechanics for enhanced realism.
