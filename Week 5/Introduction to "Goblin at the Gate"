Introduction to "Goblin at the Gate"
This project is an extension of the agent-following-mouse example demonstrated in class, 
evolving into an interactive survival game titled "Goblin at the Gate." 
The game introduces a heroic goblin struggling to survive against an ever-growing horde of enemies.

Gameplay Mechanics
Enemy Behavior: 
The enemies continuously chase the goblin with an increasing speed over time. 
Each enemy has its own size and attack value, making them more dangerous as the game progresses.

Avoidance & Survival: 
The goblin must dodge enemies to avoid losing life unless it activates a shield by picking up the blue square.

Power-Ups: 
Collecting a green square (potion) restores life, 
while the blue square (shield) temporarily grants invincibility, allowing the goblin to crash into enemies without taking damage.

Combat System:
The goblin fires bullets every 5 seconds, launching 6 projectiles to eliminate enemies.
When shielded, the goblin not only becomes invulnerable but also:
Shoots 16 bullets instead of 6
Gains unlimited shooting ability during the 2-second shield duration
Can crash into enemies to destroy them instantly

Each enemy defeated grants a score, and the challenge is to survive as long as possible while maximizing points.

Design Inspiration
The design of "Goblin at the Gate" draws inspiration from readings on "Vehicles" and interactive agent systems, 
particularly those featuring “flocking behaviors”, such as schools of fish or swarms of creatures. 
The game's adaptive enemy movement, emergent challenge, and dynamic power-ups create an engaging balance between survival and strategy.

This project explores AI-driven movement, interactive agent behavior, and player adaptability in an evolving, fast-paced game environment
